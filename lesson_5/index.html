						<span>In 1993</span>, remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from
						Vauxhall
						Bridge.[38] Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to 1750–1285 BC.[38] <span>In 2010</span>,
						foundations of a
						large timber structure, dated to 4800–4500 BC,[39] were found on the Thames's south foreshore
						downstream
						from Vauxhall Bridge.[40] Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames, where the

						River Effra flows into the Thames.[40]

					<p>
						Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was
						founded by the Romans around 47 AD,[2] about four years after their invasion of 43 AD.[41] This only
						lasted until about 61 AD, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the
						ground.[42]
					</p>
					<p>
						The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered, superseding Colchester as the principal city of
						the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a
						population of about 60,000.[43]

						With the early 5th-century collapse of Roman rule, the walled city of Londinium was effectively
						abandoned, although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin-in-the-Fields until about 450.[44]
						From about 500, an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman
						city.[45] By about 680 the city had become a major port again, but there is little evidence of
						large-scale production. From the 820s repeated Viking assaults brought decline. Three are recorded;
						those in 851 and 886 succeeded, while the last, in 994, was rebuffed.[46]
					</p>
					<p>
						The Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England, its boundary running roughly
						from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking
						incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord, Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in
						886. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Alfred "refounded" London in 886. Archaeological research
						shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman
						walls. London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about 950.[47]

						After winning the Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly
						completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.[49] William built the Tower of London, the first of
						many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south-eastern corner of the city, to intimidate the
						inhabitants.[50] In 1097, William II began building Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same
						name. It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster.[51]

						In the 12th century, the institutions of central government, which had hitherto followed the royal
						English court around the country, grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed, for
						most purposes at Westminster, although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower. While the City of
						Westminster developed into a true governmental capital, its distinct neighbour, the City of London,
						remained England's largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique
						administration, the Corporation of London. In 1100, its population was some 18,000; by 1300 it had
						grown to nearly 100,000.[52] With the Black Death in the mid-14th century, London lost nearly a third
						of its population.[53] London was the focus of the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.[54]
					</p>
					<p>
						London was a centre of England's Jewish population before their expulsion by Edward I in 1290.
						Violence against Jews occurred in 1190, when it was rumoured that the new king had ordered their
						massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.[55] In 1264 during the Second Barons'
						War, Simon de Montfort's rebels killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.[56]
