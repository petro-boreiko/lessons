						<p>
							When the French poet and traveller Théophile Gautier first went to London in 1843, by ship, he was
							quite astonished. He wrote that London was the "capital of enormities and of proud rebellion".
							London Docks in 1880London's docks, as Théophile Gautier or Charles Dickens would have seen them.
							Painting by Atkinson Grimshaw, 1880 "On this gigantic scale," he continued, "industry almost
							becomes poetry, a poetry in which nature plays no part, but which is a result of the immense
							development of human will." In 1843, London really was very different from any other city. It was
							much bigger than any other city, and it was the capital of the most industrialised nation in the
							world. It was already a city with a long history, of course. London had become the British capital
							in Roman times, but since then, it had been built and destroyed and rebuilt so many times that
							there were few traces left of the capital city of Roman Britain, except deep below the ground.
							Today, the oldest buildings in London include the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey, which are
							almost a thousand years old.

					<img src="img/tower-london.jpg" alt="The Tower of London, built in the 11th century" class="bottom-img">

					<div class="bottom-text">
						<p>
							Though the Tower was always a part of London, Westminster Abbey was once over a mile from the
							capital city. For centuries, "London" just covered the area corresponding more or less to the Roman
							city. Today, this part of London is still called the City of London, and is the heart of the bigger
							"London". Until recently, "the City" was home to hundreds of thousands of people; but today its
							population is actually well less than ten thousand! Today the City is the heart of London's
							financial district, full of bankers and businessmen by day, almost deserted by night.
						</p>

						<p>
							Back in the Middle Ages, the City was already becoming too small. In the 11th century, monks built
							a big new abbey at Westminster, and King Cnut began to build a palace beside it. King Ethelred, his
							successor, then decided to move his court from the city of Winchester, to the palace of
							Westminster. Westminster has been the seat of the English, then British, parliament since 1265, and
							London has been the capital city for even longer. While the parliament was established in
							Westminster, the City's growing population kept spreading to other villages all round. Villages
							like Chelsea and Hackney eventually became swallowed up by the metropolis which kept growing and
							growing. Today, Westminster, which contains Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben, Piccadilly
							Circus, Trafalgar Square, and London's most famous shopping district, is part of the "West End' of
							Central London. Nearby, Chelsea is an expensive residential area, and Hackney is a working-class
							district: they are all parts of London.

						<p>
							In spite of its age, Central London does not have many very old buildings. The City itself was
							burnt to the ground in the terrible fire of 1666, and was almost totally rebuilt after it. Large
							parts of London were also rebuilt in the nineteenth century and have been rebuilt again since then,
							for different reasons. Charles Dickens, the author of Oliver Twist and other famous novels, lived
							in the London that Théophile Gautier visited, and has left us with terrible descriptions of the
							conditions in which the poor of London lived and worked in those days. Millions of people worked in
							the great city, with its docks, its offices and shops, and its services. In those days most people
							who lived in cities were poor, and lived in squalid conditions. But a new "middle class" was
							growing, specially in London, where there were lots of jobs. In this way, London, the biggest city
							in the world, was also the first "modern" city. It remained the world's biggest city until after
							the second world war. Since then it has continued to change, but got smaller; but with over seven
							million inhabitants , today's "Greater London" is, with Paris, one of the two biggest cities in
							Europe; and also one of the most fascinating.

					Different parts of London.
				</h3>

				<div class="parts-text">
					<p>
						London is one of the richest cities in Europe, and lots of people in London have plenty of money to
						spend. But like almost every big city, London has its prosperity but also its poverty.Most tourists
						visit the "West End", with its shops, cinemas, theatres and monuments. This is London's front
						window, where the streets are clean and most people, including the tourists, have jobs, and money
						to spend.
					</p>

					<p>
						Harrod's store, in Knightsbridge, claims it is the most famous shop in the world; in theory you can
						buy anything there, from an elephant to a pencil (though naturally, they would have to order the
						elephant specially for you, there are none on the shelves!) In the small streets behind Regent
						Street, there are all sorts of specialist shops, selling high-quality products to people who can
						afford them. "Gentlemen's tailor since 1788," says the sign outside a tiny shop with beautiful
						suits in its window. Expensive suits. Most of this shop's customers are businessmen, celebrities
						and diplomats; here at least, the foreign customer, after his first English lesson, can say "my
						tailor is rich".
					</p>
				</div>

				<img src="img/bond-st.jpg" alt="New Bond Street" class="parts-img">


				<div class="parts-text">
					<p>
						Two miles to the north east of Regent Street, the scene is very different. Here you are in the
						"inner city" district of London, where many of the streets are dirty, the shops look cheap, and the
						people do not look rich. Few tourists visit Islington, Bethnal Green, Brixton and London's other
						depressed areas. A lot of the inhabitants here are from minorities — mostly West Indian or Asian —
						and many of them do not have any work. Those who do have work are often in unskilled jobs which do
						not pay well; cleaners, dustmen, shop assistants.
					</p>

					<p>
						Nevertheless, though these areas of London are poor, they cannot be described as ghettoes, and
						while levels of crime are above average in many parts of the inner city, these are not dangerous
						areas. Twenty years ago, there was rioting and violence in the streets in Brixton, but since then
						things have been generally calm.
